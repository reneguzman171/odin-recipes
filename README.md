# odin-recipes

This is my first proper project uploaded to my GitHub repo

I will have built a basic recipe website. It won't be pretty but it is mine.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Build HTML boilerplate
- Build separate webpages for the website
- Link to those webpages
- Embed images
- Use atomic commit messages
- Build unordered and ordered lists
- Use different sized headings to separate and organize the webpages
